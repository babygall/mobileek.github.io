<p >Here's how to install a new version of Android (or ROM) 
on your device for an even better Android experience.</p>











<h3>What's a ROM?</h3>











<p> 
A custom ROM 
give you the latest version of Android before your manufacturer does, 
 it can replace your version of Android with a 
clean, stock version.Or, change your version
with awesome new features&#8212;it's up to you.</p>











<p>Each version of the OS has a 
specific goal in mind, and as such differs quite a bit from the others. 
. You'll need to unlock your bootloader and flash a custom recovery 
, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too difficult.</p>













 





























<p>There are a lot of different ROMs out there, you can search for it in google.</p>

		<p ></p><h3>Step One: Unlock Your Bootloader and Flash a Custom Recovery</h3>

 alt="How to Flash a ROM to Your Android Phone"></p>











<p> you do not 
 need to root your phone to flash a ROM&#8212;you just need to unlock
 your bootloader and flash a custom recovery. However, this process 
usually goes hand-in-hand with rooting&#8212;and most custom ROMs come with 
root access&#8212;so what you think of as "rooting your phone" is probably 
what you're going to have to do first.</p>











<p>
 search around sites like XDA 
Developers for instructions on how to unlock the bootloader of your 
specific phone, which recovery you should use (usually <a href="http://teamw.in/project/twrp2" target="_blank">TWRP</a> or
 <a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager" target="_blank">ClockworkMod</a>), and how to flash it.</p>









****************************

<p>
A lot of methods and one-click apps will root your phone anyways, 
, and this can vary from phone 
to phone
.</p>











<p> Unlocking your bootloader will wipe your phone, and without root access, you won't be able to back up very much. So,
 save anything you want to keep on your computer&#8212;you will have to set up your phone from scratch just this once before continuing.</p>

	<p>When you're done, return here and continue to step two for the rest of the ROMming process.</p>











<h3>Step Two: Make a Backup of Your System, Apps, and Data</h3>











<p>Now that you've got a custom recovery on your phone, the first thing to do&#8212;before you 
 make a big change to your system&#8212;is back it up. First, we'll make a 
Nandroid backup, which is basically a image of your current system. That
 way, if something goes wrong, you can restore your phone to exactly
 the way it was before you started tweaking. This will save you a lot of
 hassle if something goes.
To do this:</p>











<ol><li>Restart your mobile and enter recovery mode.  usually involves some permutation of pressing the 
power and volume buttons at the same time.</li><li>Head to the "Backup" 
or "Nandroid" section of your recovery mode. The default settings should
 be fine. If given the option, give your backup a name that helps you 
remember what it is (like "Pre-CyanogenMod Backup 01-17-14"). Confirm 
your backup and let it run.</li><li>Wait for the backup to finish. This may take awhile.</li></ol>











<p>I also recommend making a second type of backup: your 
apps and settings. If you just unlocked your bootloader and wiped your phone, you can skip this step, but any time you flash a ROM in the future,
 you can back up your apps first, since you may have to wipe your phone before you flash. With a backup, you can easily restore those apps and data
 
 after flashing, making the process a lot simpler.
 
 We recommend using Titanium Backup.</p>

alt="How to Flash a ROM to Your Android Phone"></p>











<p>This
 is different from a Nandroid backup because it just backs up the apps 
themselves, which you can then restore on any ROM you want. Nandroid 
backups take your entire system as it is, ROM included.</p>











<p>Note that 
you'll need to be rooted to use Titanium 
</p>











<ol><li>Open Titanium Backup and grant it root permissions if it asks for 
them. If it experiences any problems with root, it'll tell you right 
now.</li><li>Tap the "Batch" button in the upper right-hand corner (the 
one that looks like a little checkbox). Scroll down to the "Backup" 
section and find "Backup All User Apps." Tap the "Run" button. This will
 back up any apps you've downloaded from the Play Store, and their data.
 (You can try backing up your system data as well, but I find this 
usually doesn't work very well).</li><li>Wait for it to finish. 
 
but you don't have to for this process.</li></ol>














<h3>Step Three: Download and Flash the ROM of Your Choice</h3>











<p ><img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--sRmzelgd--/19d4up80e3waxjpg.jpg"   
alt="How to Flash a ROM to Your Android Phone"></p>











<p>Now comes the fun part: flashing your ROM. First, you need to find the ROM you want. Again, 
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/this-database-of-android-roms-helps-you-choose-the-best-1449794780">
this chart is a good place to start</a>, as is <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5915093/five-best-android-roms">
our list of the five most popular</a>. You may also want to poke around sites like the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com" target="_blank">
XDA Developers forums</a> to see what's available for your particular phone.</p>











<p>When
 you've found a ROM you want to try, download it and save it to your 
phone. It should come in the form of a fairly large ZIP file, so you'll 
probably want to be on Wi-Fi to download it. You can either download it 
directly from your phone, or download it on your computer and transfer 
it over via USB.</p>











<p>To flash your ROM:</p>











<ol><li>Reboot your phone into Recovery mode.</li><li>Head to the "Install" or "Install ZIP from SD Card" section of your recovery.</li><li>
Navigate to the ZIP file you downloaded earlier, and select it from the list to flash it.</li><li>Wait for the process to complete.</li><li>
Depending
 on your situation (see below), you may also need to wipe your data 
and/or cache. In TWRP, you'll find this under the "Wipe" section, and in
 ClockworkMod, you'll need to either choose the "Wipe Data/Factory 
Reset" option or the "Wipe Cache Partition" option. When you're done, 
you're free to reboot into your new ROM.</li></ol>











<p>So, when should you wipe your data and cache? Here are a few general guidelines:</p>











<ul><li>If you're flashing a ROM different than the one you're currently 
running, you should wipe data and cache. Essentially, this performs a 
factory reset on your phone, and you will lose all your data.</li><li>If
 you're flashing a new version of a ROM you're already running, we 
recommend wiping your data and cache&#8212;but you should be able to get away
 with just wiping the cache, meaning you get to keep all your apps and 
settings.</li></ul>











<p>Remember, if you backed everything up with 
Titanium, then doing a factory reset isn't all that bad, since you can 
just restore most of it. Keep in mind that even if you're just upgrading
 your existing ROM, <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/getting-bad-battery-life-422-your-verizon-nexus-try-factory-reset" target="_blank">
 factory resets can be helpful</a>.
 If you only wipe your cache, note that a few apps may run into issues, 
but reinstalling them or wiping that app's data usually fixes the 
problem.</p>











<p>When you reboot, you should be in your shiny new ROM, 
ready to play! But what? There's no Play Store? Read on for the last 
step of the process...</p>











<h3>Step Four: Download and Flash Google Apps</h3>











<p ><img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--mM5PGfMn--/18r7g6urkrydwjpg.jpg"   alt="How to Flash a ROM to Your Android Phone"></p>











<p>Because
 Google's apps are not open source, custom ROMs can't bundle Google's 
apps&#8212;like Gmail, Hangouts, or the Play Store&#8212;with their ROMs. That 
means you'll need to download and flash them separately. Luckily, this 
is pretty easy to do: just head to <a href="http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Google_Apps" target="_blank">this page on RootzWiki</a> 
to find out which ZIP file you need, download it to your phone, and flash it just like you did the ROM in step three. 
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/gapps-manager-gets-you-the-right-google-apps-for-your-r-1501497103">Gapps Manager in lifehacker.com </a> 
is also a great app that'll help you find the right package if you're stuck, and you can 
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2589167" target="_blank">download the APK from XDA Developers</a>.</p>













 





























<p>Once
 you've flashed the latest Google Apps package, you should be all set! 
You'll have a new ROM with tons of settings to play with.
