</p><p>If you have decided to switch from an android phone to an <strong>iPhone</strong>,
you must transfer your contacts from Android to iPhone which seem like a hard job to do
 But i fact it is very easy to do this.
The main idea of doing such a transfer is to create a backup of your contacts from the Android Phone to either Desktop machine 
or to the cloud, and then sync that back up with your new iPhone.There are four different ways you can do the task, which are 
explained as follows:</p>

<h2>Using Google Accounts</h2>
<p>If you are an android user, it is highly likely that you will have a Google
Account. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All of your contacts can easily be stored on your Google Account. To transfer contacts from android to 
iPhone using this way, follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First: go to the Settings section on your Android.</li>
<li>Choose the option : Accounts and Sync&#8221;. It could come under different, but similar, names on your android device
settings.</li>
<li>Enter your Google Account details.</li>
<li>After that, enable synchronization and let Google synchronize all your contacts with its data.</li>
</ol>
<p>All your contacts will now be saved in your Google Account.</p>
<p>To download all the contacts on your iPhone device, follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your iPhone, go to Settings.</li>
<li>Open the option of Mail.</li>
<li>Open the option of Contacts and add your Google account.</li>
<li>You have to make sure that the contacts are enable for your Google Account.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be able to find all your contacts in your iPhone. This was the easiest way. If this doesn&#8217;t work, there are 
other ways too.</p><p >

<h2>The Thorough Way</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open the settings of your iPhone</li>
<li>Go to Mail, Contacts, Calender</li>
<li>Select the Option of &#8220;Add Account&#8221;</li>
<li>Select Other</li>
<li>After that, choose the option saying Add CardDAV Account</li>
<li>Fill out your information of Google Account in the fields mentioned below:
<ol>
<li>For server, you have to enter &#8220;Google.com&#8221;</li>
<li>In the field of Username, use your google email address.</li>
<li>After that, enter your Google Account Password in the password field. In case that you have Google 2 &#8211; Step Verification on,
please make sure that you enter an application specific password.</li>
<li>After that, you will be asked to enter a description of the account. It is to decide whether your account is personal or not.</li>

<li>Select the button of &#8220;Next&#8221; from the top of screen.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You also have to make sure that the option saying &#8220;Contacts&#8221; is turned on to make sure the contacts synchronization.</li>

<li>After follow the above procedure, all you have to do is open the app named contacts in your iPhone. 
The contacts will start synchronizing with your Google Account.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sim Swap</h2>
<p>If your Android and iPhone use the sims of same size, you can copy all your Android contacts into the sim, put that sim in the
iPhone and copy the contacts back to the iPhone. This is not the most efficient method, but it will work.</p>
<h2>Through&#160;An App</h2>
<p>If all the above methods fail, you can transfer android contacts to iPhone through an app. This is a sure way of transferring your 
contacts. The application&#8217;s name is CopyTrans Contact. It is a app that allows you to control your iPhone contacts through PC screen.</p>

<p>In order to transfer your contacts this way, you will need to follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Android phone, go to the option of &#8220;Contacts&#8221;.</li>
<li>Using the menu, select the option of &#8220;Import/Export Contact&#8221;.</li>
<li>Choose any of the options between &#8220;Export to SD Card&#8221; or &#8220;Export to USB Storage&#8221;. 
Doing this will put all of your Android Contacts on a single file of VCard.</li>
<li>Now, back your contacts up on your PC by connecting your Android phone to the PC and using it as a mass storage.</li>
<li>Once the vCard file is in the PC, download and install the app CopyTrans.</li>
<li>Connect the iPhone</li>
<li>When the main window of the App appears, drag and drop the said vCard file to the open window of the app.</li>
</ol>
<p>The app will copy and transfer all of your contacts to the iPhone. I would suggest you to try the four methods in 
the order I mentioned, as the first method is the easiest and fastest one and the later ones are harder and slower.</p>
