<div><p > <h1 >Lost German Adventurer Found Mummified Inside Drifting Yacht Near Philippines!</h1> </p><p ></p>  <p >   </p><p>The embalmed body of a German traveler who was most recently seen alive in 2009 has been found on his yacht off the shore of the Philippines. Two angler found the assemblage of Manfred Fritz Bajorat close to the radio telephone of his 40-foot yacht called Sayo, maybe ready to make a trouble call. Bajorat&#8217;s reason for death is obscure right now. The body was mummified due to conditions at sea: salty air, dry winds and hot temperatures.</p><p>Additionally found on the yacht was a note that Bajorat kept in touch with his wife Claudia, who kicked the bucket of disease in 2010. The note said:&#160;&#8220;Thirty years we&#8217;re been together on the same path. Then the power of the demons was stronger than the will to live. You&#8217;re gone. May your soul find its peace. Your Manfred.&#8221;
