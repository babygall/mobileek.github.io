<div><p>In order to establish a connection with your device, device driver installation is required and is automatically done by downloading from the server Kingo Android Root offers.</p><p><br></p><p >Scenario One: Already has device driver installed</p><p>Some users have questions about driver installation and asked if we could skip this step because they have already installed the driver before. The thing is there is a requirement of minimum version of your device driver. If the version of installed driver is below this required minimum version, Kingo Android Root will automatically download and install it for you.<br> So, if Kingo Android Root is going through the process of driver downloading, it probably means that the driver you installed does not fit the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p >Scenario Two: Device driver installation takes a million years</p><p>Maybe you have encountered this kind of dilemma, Kingo Android Root is kind of stuck in the device driver installation process and couldn't move on to the next step. What should you do? First of all, I am so sorry the server did not serve you well. Now you may have two ways to go with. <br><br>P.S. Windows 8 users need to modify the starting option: "advanced starting options" and enable option 7 after restarting "enable non signed drivers", then the driver can be installed. <a href="/troubleshoot/driver-installation-looping-on-windows-8.htm" target="_blank" title="Driver installation looping on Windows 8">How to install driver on Windows 8?</a></p></div>
