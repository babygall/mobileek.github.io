 <p ><p>Posted on:</p> Feb 27, 2016 <p>Say good-bye to tangled wires and misplaced charging cables. Spanish start-up MiniBatt presented a smartphone charging system that can be installed in any piece of furniture, regardless of the material. To charge a device, you just have to put it on top of a desk, chair or table. The company hopes to convince furniture makers to incorporate the charger into its designs.</p><p>The device consists of an 80 mm disk which can be placed under any table or surface of wood, plastic or glass, plugged into an electricity outlet, making it invisible to users. To charge the mobile phone battery, you just need to place it on the table, on top of a sticker indicating the charging zone. Thus, the phone does not need to connect to any device nor does it need direct contact with the charger.</p>&#13;

        <p>"We're beginning to sell the product to furniture makers, restaurants, offices, stations and waiting area managers, in other words, any space where it might be useful for a user to have a charger handy," said MiniBatt's managing director, Jordi Gilberga.</p><p>The company behind this charger was originally dedicated to manufacturing automobile components. In 2012 there was a generational change in the management structure and the firm began to work in the area of portable energy banks that can give power to flat batteries in vehicles.<br>-</p><p ></p><p>-</p><p ></p>		        &#13;
