<h2>Why stop automatic app updates on Android phones?</h2>
<p>One advantage of manually updating your apps is that you can find out when an app has been updated. That way, you also know when to check out its new features.

<p>If this sounds like you, help is at hand. It&#8217;s not hard to disable automatic app updates on any Android device. Just follow a few simple steps and you&#8217;ll be in control of your updates in no time.</p>
<h2>How to stop updates on Android devices quickly and easily</h2>
<p>The easiest way to disable automatic app updates on your device is to use the phone&#8217;s software. This should work for both Lollipop and Marshmallow users.</p> 
<ol>
<li>The first thing to do is to open the &#8220;<a href="https://play.google.com/store" target="_blank">Play Store</a>&#8221; app on your device.</li>
<li>Now, look for a box containing three parallel lines next to the search field and click it.</li>
<li>A menu should now appear. Tap on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; option and then on the option titled &#8220;auto update apps&#8221; in the &#8220;general&#8221; section.</li>
<li>Here, you will have a range of options. Simply choose &#8220;do not auto update apps&#8221; and your phone is yours again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many app updates are important to maintain the latest versions and to keep your phone as secure as possible, so few people will want to totally stop updating. Instead, you can choose to receive notifications when new updates are available. Simply click on the &#8220;notifications&#8221; option on the &#8220;settings menu.&#8221;</p>
